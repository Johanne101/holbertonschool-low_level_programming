Hash tables

Hashing
--------
<p>
Hashing is a technique used to access faster to elements
that maps the given data with a lesser key for comparisons.
In general, for this technique,
the keys are traced using hash function into a table known as the hash table.

### Hash function?

The hash function is a **function that uses the constant-time operation to store and retrieve the value from the hash table,**
which is applied on the keys as integers and this is used as the address for values in the hash table.

>> ***Hash Function*** takes a group of characters (called a key)
>> and maps it to a value of a certain length (called a hash value or hash).
>> The hash value is representative of the original string of characters,
>> but is normally smaller than the original.
